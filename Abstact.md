Weather Dashboard Application - React Development Test
Introduction
As part of our selection process, we invite you to complete a practical task designed to assess your
skills in React development. You will be creating a simple weather dashboard application. This test
will help us understand your proficiency with React, including component creation, state
management, API integration, and your approach to problem-solving.

Objective
Your task is to develop a weather dashboard application using React. The application should allow
users to input a city name, fetch weather information for that city using a public API, and display the
results.

Requirements
User Interface
Input Field: Include a text input for users to enter the name of the city.
Submit Button: A button to request weather data.
Weather Display: Show the following weather details:
 City Name
 Temperature (in Celsius)
 Weather Description (e.g., clear sky, rain)
 Wind Speed
 Humidity
Functionality
API Integration: Use the OpenWeatherMap API (or any similar free weather API) to retrieve weather
data.
State Management: Ensure the UI updates reflect the fetched data.
Error Handling: Gracefully handle and display errors (e.g., city not found, API request errors).
Code Requirements
 Utilize functional components and React hooks.
 Keep the application modular with separate components for the form and weather display.
 Implement basic styling to enhance user experience. You may use plain CSS or a CSS-in-JS
solution.

Bonus (Optional)
 Implement automatic weather data fetching based on the user's current location.
 Display a loading indicator while data is being fetched.
Submission
Deadline: 3 days
Format: Please submit your solution as a GitHub repository link. Make sure the repository is public.
Ensure your repository contains a README with instructions on how to set up and run your project
locally.
Evaluation
Your submission will be evaluated based on functionality, code quality, use of React features, UI/UX
design, and how you handle errors and edge cases. Bonus points are awarded for completing the
optional tasks, but they are not required.

Thank you for participating in this development test. We look forward to reviewing your submission.
